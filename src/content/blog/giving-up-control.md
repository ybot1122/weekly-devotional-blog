title: "Giving Up Control"
description: "This week, the Lord extends a deeper invitation: to let go, to listen, and to trust. Jesus declared, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me” (Matthew 28:18). To walk in that authority, we must submit to Him completely. We cannot wield power we are not subject to (James 4:7)."

This weekend was graduation weekend, and the city welcomed people from across the country and around the world as they celebrated the successful completion of their ward’s degree program. My wife and I had the opportunity to visit with a missionary serving one of the most dangerous and difficult places to reach. In quiet and measured tones, he shared how the Lord is moving—bringing this people group **to** communities where Christians live. God is sending them to be reached, and all Christians need to do is to show them Christ.

This reflects the ministry Jesus called us to: being salt and light in the world (Matthew 5:13-16). Our presence and witness keep others from bitterness and darkness. Jesus said to Peter, “On this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it” (Matthew 16:18). Notice that this declaration does not mention or allude to human intervention; it is God’s work. Consider Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, tasked with rebuilding the temple after exile. The work stalled because of political opposition, low morale, and limited resources. In the natural, it seemed the situation demanded strategy, strength, and leadership grit, but God interrupted the moment with a disruptive and unexpected word through the prophet Zechariah: “Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the Lord of hosts” (Zechariah 4:6). Too often, we carry ministry burdens as if success depends on our eloquence, urgency, or preparation. But God advances His kingdom through surrendered hearts, not impressive efforts. He is not limited by the places we cannot go; He simply asks us to be faithful where we are—and to trust that He is already doing the heavy lifting (Philippians 1:6).

When Jesus visited Martha’s home, she was busy with preparations while her sister Mary sat quietly at Jesus’ feet. Frustrated, Martha asked, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me to do the work alone?” (Luke 10:40). Jesus gently answered, “You are worried and upset about many things, but only one thing is necessary” (Luke 10:41-42). Sometimes, we miss the most important thing by being distracted with many tasks, thinking that we are in control. This illusion of control is captured by the psychologist Julian Rotter, who introduced the idea of “locus of control,” which describes an individual's belief about how much control they have over events affecting them. This belief system significantly influences how people perceive challenges, their motivation, and overall outlook on life. It also influences our relationship with God and how much we can walk in the supernatural. This psychological insight reveals why trusting God requires both surrender and active participation—personal responsibility balanced with reliance on divine guidance.

I believe there is a message for anyone who feels stalled, stuck, or abandoned by circumstances that continue to elude them. This week, the Lord extends a deeper invitation: to let go, to listen, and to trust. Jesus declared, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me” (Matthew 28:18). To walk in that authority, we must submit to Him completely. We cannot wield power we are not subject to (James 4:7). The temptation to control everything convinces us that if we stop pushing, all will fall apart. Spiritually, recognizing the limits of our control and surrendering to the Lord of all authority aligns with shifting from an internal to a more balanced locus of control—acknowledging personal responsibility while trusting divine guidance (Proverbs 3:5-6). Personal responsibility means coming before God with open hands and hearts, prepared to give Him all He asks.

Like Zerubbabel and Martha, we face a choice: rely on our own strength or surrender control to God. Our obsession with control fuels many of today’s struggles. The enemy cleverly makes us feel in charge while pulling strings behind the scenes (John 10:10). This illusion keeps us from the breakthroughs God desires for us. Let this be a call to lay down the weight of control so we can soar freely. True breakthrough begins there (Psalm 37:5).
