title: "Consider Consecration: Tilling the Heart for God"
description: "In Jesus’ parable of the sower (Mark 4, Matthew 13), we see a powerful metaphor: the same seed is sown in different soils, but the outcome varies. Why? Because the Word isn’t the issue. The Word never changes. The seed is perfect. The variable is the soil—our hearts, our alignment, our level of submission."

We don’t drift into consecration. It doesn’t happen by accident, nor is it reserved for the few perceived to be ultra-spiritual. Consecration is a conscious decision to live set apart for God’s purposes, to reorder our desires and surrender our freedoms in exchange for divine alignment. But in today’s world—cluttered by convenience, overexposure, and emotional fatigue—the slow, deep work of becoming grounded in God often feels foreign. In Jesus’ parable of the sower (Mark 4, Matthew 13), we see a powerful metaphor: the same seed is sown in different soils, but the outcome varies. Why? Because the Word isn’t the issue. The Word never changes. The seed is perfect. The variable is the soil—our hearts, our alignment, our level of submission. The difference between spiritual fruitfulness and stagnation lies in the depth, readiness, and consistency of our inner lives. Consecration, then, is not about striving harder—it’s about surrendering deeper. It is not about performance. It is posture; it is submission. It is the daily process of tilling our hearts to receive, hold, and respond to God’s Word.

**It begins with obedience**<br />
Isaac lived through a famine—unlike the one his father Abraham faced (Genesis 26:1). It’s important to note that Scripture explicitly states this famine was different from the one in Abraham’s time—an intentional marker by the Holy Spirit to show us that though seasons may look similar, God’s instruction for each is unique. While Abraham had gone to Egypt during famine (Genesis 12), God gave Isaac a different command: “Do not go down to Egypt.” Even though the Bible doesn't record Isaac expressing a desire to go to Egypt, God addresses it directly. Why? Because God often speaks to the motives and fears we haven't yet verbalized. All logic pointed toward Egypt: a place of abundance and stability. But God told Isaac to stay in Gerar, a place of dryness and uncertainty. It made no sense, but Isaac obeyed. And in the same year, he reaped a hundredfold (Genesis 26:12). This moment teaches us that consecration sometimes looks like remaining in a place that seems barren—whether a job, a ministry, a relationship, or a stage of life—simply because God said, "Stay." Like Isaac, we may be tempted to follow the most reasonable or self-reliant path, but the consecrated life asks, "What has God spoken?" Obedience tills the ground. It prepares us to receive supernatural provision in natural famine. Isaac’s soil was good not because the land was rich, but because his heart was aligned.

**Be mindful of the colors of sorrow**<br />
In Gethsemane, Jesus found His disciples asleep during His greatest moment of need. But the Bible notes something important: "They were exhausted from sorrow" (Luke 22:45). This wasn’t laziness—it was emotional and spiritual fatigue. Many of us live here. We are weary from unanswered prayers, heartbreak, or discouragement. Fatigue makes it hard to pray, hard to focus, hard to remain spiritually alert. Like the disciples, we risk sleeping through divine invitations simply because our hearts are heavy. Consecration means choosing to stay spiritually awake even in pain. It helps us show up in prayer even when our soul would rather retreat. God doesn’t rebuke weakness—He strengthens faithfulness. The tilling of our soil in sorrow leads to deeper roots in God.

**Don't dwell on the missed opportunities**<br />
After the transfiguration, the disciples asked Jesus about the prophecy that Elijah must come first. Jesus explained that Elijah had already come in the person of John the Baptist, but the people did not recognize him. (Matthew 17:10–13)This is a sobering word for today. How often do we miss God’s movement because we’re looking for a different form? John came in the wilderness, wearing camel’s hair and preaching repentance. He didn’t fit the mold of a messianic forerunner, so the people rejected him. Consecration tunes our ears to God's voice in unfamiliar vessels. We must be willing to recognize divine work in correction, delay, or even silence. The spiritually attuned heart doesn’t just hear God in miracles— it hears Him in the quiet and ordinary moments of life.

**Psalm 15: A blueprint for the consecrated soil**<br />
This psalm offers a vivid portrait of what the life of consecrated soil looks like. David begins with a searching question: "Lord, who may dwell in your sacred tent? Who may live on your holy mountain?" This is not just about access, but about sustained nearness—who can remain close to God. The answer is deeply rooted in character and integrity. It describes the soil of a life that has been cultivated through obedience, tested through trials, and refined through surrender. The person who qualifies to dwell in God’s presence is like rich, tilled soil—ready to receive and nurture the seed of the Word. They walk in integrity, not for performance, but because righteousness has taken root in their inner being. Their words are sincere and untouched by deceit. Their loyalty to the Lord and His ways is unwavering—they honor those who fear the Lord and keep their promises, even when keeping them is painful. They reject bribes and refuse to exploit others for selfish gain. This passage draws the spiritual principle of consecration out of abstract spirituality and plants it firmly in everyday life. Just as good soil is not formed in a day, so too is a consecrated life developed over time—through rhythms of faithfulness, discipline, and alignment. Psalm 15 becomes our guide for examining the condition of our own soil. Are we trustworthy? Are we aligned? Are we uncluttered by compromise? In a world where cutting corners and bending truth is commonplace, Psalm 15 calls us to a countercultural alignment. It says, in effect, “Let your soil be deep. Let your roots go down in righteousness.” Consecration, in this sense, is not about performance—it is about becoming a person whose life can host the presence of God. The psalm ends with this stabilizing promise: “Whoever does these things will never be shaken.” This is the fruit of good soil. When the storms come, when the world wavers, those who have allowed God to cultivate their hearts through truth, consistency, and alignment will stand firm. Their lives will bear lasting fruit—not because of talent or charisma—but because the soil was ready.

The Word is still being sown. God is still speaking. The only question is: What kind of soil am I becoming?
