## Happy New Year!

Welcome to your year of unmissable evidence. There is a truth in scripture that we often take for granted. Whenever God gives an assignment, He always provides the template or plans and equips us with the necessary skills and anointing. In other words, God never leaves us to figure things out on our own, nor does He intend for us to accomplish His work in our own way. This truth is especially important as we step into a new year. I am intentionally referring to it as a "new year" rather than just "another year." This is not just a continuation of time; it’s an invitation to break free from the status quo. Embrace this year as a gift from God, one that holds the promise of encounters far greater than you have ever known.

God never intended for us to rely on our own wisdom or abilities to fulfill His purposes. He provides everything we need. For instance, when God called Noah to build the ark, Noah was not an engineer, nor had such a structure ever existed—it had never even rained before. Yet, God gave Noah the blueprint and the ability to build it. Similarly, when God desired a tabernacle, He provided detailed plans and anointed the builders with exceptional skill, wisdom, and understanding (Exodus 31:3). They did not depend on their own knowledge or strength. Time and again in scripture, we see God calling people to tasks and empowering them to victory. When Gideon began with 30,000 men, God reduced the number to 300 to teach total dependence on Him, not on human resources or strength or connection.

Yesterday, I had an encounter with a Lyft driver that offered a profound reminder of this lesson. I ordered a Lyft ride, expecting a routine trip. However, the driver decided to guess my destination instead of following the navigation system. When he arrived at the place he assumed was my destination, he was surprised that the navigation app was still saying 9 minutes away. I pointed out that it was not the destination. I couldn’t understand why he relied on his own assumptions instead of simply trusting the directions provided by the app. The journey ended up taking more than twice the expected time. Although frustrating, this incident served as a powerful illustration for the new year: how often do we veer off course in life because we rely on our assumptions rather than the guidance available to us? Just as the driver trusted his memory over the navigation system, we sometimes lean on our understanding instead of trusting God’s direction.

This is not another year to figure things out on your own. It’s a year to wholly depend on God and experience all that He has planned out for you. To activate this total dependence, there are three key steps:

**1\. Treasure God’s Word:**<br />
The first step is to intentionally store God’s Word in your heart. These words are not fleeting moments but treasures that sustain you in times of need. Just as a well-stocked reservoir provides water during a drought, treasuring God’s Word builds a foundation of trust, intimacy, and dependence on Him. His Word offers detailed instructions, blueprints, and the frameworks we need. We should cherish it above all else and pursue it with the passion of David (Psalm 119:11) and Joshua (Joshua 1:8).

**2\. Embrace vulnerability:**<br />
There will be moments when you feel like you’ve run out of strength, resources, or plans. This is not failure; it’s an invitation to embrace vulnerability before God. It means approaching Him with honesty and humility, laying down your own agendas and recognizing that you came into the world with nothing and will leave with nothing. As Job said, “Naked I came, and naked I go.” There’s no need for pretense or a polished presentation—just come as you are. In this place of raw dependence, you can experience His power in your weakness and His grace in abundance.

**3\.Do whatever He tells you:**<br />
When you are vulnerable and open before God, you are in a position to hear and obey His voice. Once pride, distractions, and competing priorities are set aside, obedience becomes a joyful response, not a burdensome task. Trust flows naturally when your heart is anchored in His Word, and your spirit fully relies on Him.

These steps are interconnected. Treasuring God’s Word reminds you of His steadfast promises and prepares you for moments of vulnerability. Embracing vulnerability, in turn, creates the space for joyful obedience. Without a foundation in God’s truth, we cannot recognize our need for Him, and our attempts to rely on our own strength often feel burdensome or misaligned. Any priority that conflicts with God’s will becomes a barrier to hearing His voice and following His plan.
