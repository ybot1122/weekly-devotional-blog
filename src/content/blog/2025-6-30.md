title: "Unfinished Business"
description: "We are at the halfway point of the year. Rightfully so, there’s a lot of unfinished business because, well, the year is only halfway through. Each of us carries work that is not yet complete—assignments we’ve only started, prayers still unfolding, inner healing not yet fully embraced. But in God’s economy, unfinished business is not failure. It's process. It’s formation. It’s the divine rhythm of being made whole. This is a good place to pause, reflect, and reset—change your oil, tune your engine, and check that you are firing on all cylinders."

We are at the halfway point of the year. Rightfully so, there’s a lot of unfinished business because, well, the year is only halfway through. Each of us carries work that is not yet complete—assignments we’ve only started, prayers still unfolding, inner healing not yet fully embraced. But in God’s economy, unfinished business is not failure. It's process. It’s formation. It’s the divine rhythm of being made whole. This is a good place to pause, reflect, and reset—change your oil, tune your engine, and check that you are firing on all cylinders.

Over the past six months, many of us have been invited into a deeper awareness of our spiritual posture. We’ve been reminded that human strength alone cannot carry divine purposes. The call has not been to try harder, but to trust more. To loosen our grip. To trade control for communion. At the same time, life has unfolded in patterns—some fast, some slow; some filled with clarity, others clouded with uncertainty. Yet even here, in the tension between planting and reaping, between obscurity and clarity, God is working. There is meaning even in the silence. Wisdom in the slow turn of seasons. Transformation in the waiting. Some have sensed a quiet invitation to come back to the center—not to our ambitions, but to our identity. Who are we becoming? What voice are we listening to? This journey has not been about performance, but about alignment: living from a place of intimacy rather than striving; from rooted identity in Christ rather than the shifting approval of man. Others have felt the weight of surrender—the call to lay down things that once defined us, to release even the good things that have become distractions, to make room for what God really wants to do in your life. It will not be easy, but it is needful.

And still, the story is not yet complete. We are being formed for something beyond ourselves—for impact, for presence, for a life that reflects what matters most to the heart of God. There is a holy urgency—not of panic, but of purpose. It is a call to intentionality, to lift our eyes and align our daily choices with the deep convictions God is shaping within us. So here, at this halfway mark, the charge is simple and sobering: **Revisit what matters. Return to what grounds you. Reignite what has grown cold.** There is still time. There is still purpose. There is still unfinished business—but the kind that God finishes in us as we walk with Him.

There are four moments in the Scriptures that have been impressed on me as we look toward the next six months of the year. These are examples of unfinished business that I want us to use to guide our halfway reflection and reset:

1. **The Man at the Pool**<br />
   For years, this man lay paralyzed near the waters, hoping for movement, for mercy, for someone to help. Jesus met him, not just to restore his body, but to reawaken his purpose. The healing was only the beginning. His real assignment was waiting—in the temple, in obedience, in walking free from sin. Sometimes we receive a breakthrough and stop there. But healing is not the finish line. It's the start of holy responsibility. What have you been healed, delivered, or freed for?<br />
   **Midyear charge**: Don’t just receive the miracle. Step into the mission that healing unlocks.

2. **Lazarus**<br />
   Jesus didn’t rush to Lazarus’s bedside. He let death complete its cycle. Why? Because God’s plan was not to prevent death, but to overpower it. He waited until decay had set in to show us the radical reach of resurrection. The grave could not hold what God had ordained to live again. There are things in your life that feel not just dormant, but dead. Hope, opportunity, vision—sealed off by time and loss. But Jesus is never late. He shows up when the miracle will speak the loudest.<br />
   **Midyear charge**: What was buried, God will raise. Stay open to impossible restorations.

3. **Samson**<br />
   Samson wasted much of his calling chasing lesser things. But in his final moment—blinded, humbled, and seemingly defeated—he remembered why he was born. He asked for one last strength, not to be avenged, but to fulfill his divine assignment. And he did. There is unfinished business in many of us—not because we failed, but because we forgot. Or got distracted. Or simply grew tired. But God still honors a heart that turns back toward purpose. Even now, He can give you strength to finish strong.<br />
   **Midyear charge**: Ask God for strength to finish what He started in you, even if the journey has been messy.

4. **Ruth**<br />
   Ruth had every reason to fade quietly into the background—widowed, displaced, and clinging to a future she couldn’t see. Her life, by all appearances, had come to a dead end. And yet, she chose covenant over convenience, faithfulness over fear, humility over self-preservation. She refused to leave Naomi isolated in her bitterness. Instead of starting over in her own homeland, she gave up everything to ensure her mother-in-law was cared for. It would have made sense for Ruth to begin a new life on her own terms. But unfinished business called her into something higher—not just a duty to Naomi, but a destiny she couldn’t yet perceive. In choosing the hard road of commitment and selflessness, Ruth unknowingly stepped into a redemptive plan that would echo through generations.<br />
   **Midyear charge**: God can make legacy out of your loss. Don’t rush to restart—follow where grace leads. What looks like a setback may be your sacred setup.

What is the unfinished business that you need to take care of? Take this week to go back to God in prayer and fasting and reset for the rest of this year of unmissable evidence.
