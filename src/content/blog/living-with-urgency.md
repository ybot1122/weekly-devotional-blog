Have you ever wondered why we so often wait until the last moment to do our assignments? We complain that there’s never enough time, yet even when given additional time, we somehow end up racing against the clock. There’s something about urgency that sharpens our focus. When the deadline approaches, when the siren sounds, when the clock is ticking—we suddenly see what truly matters. Distractions fade. Side hustles drop. Priorities shift. Words become deliberate. Actions become bold. The apostle Paul understood this well. As his life drew to a close, his letters didn’t soften—they burned with greater fire. From a Roman prison cell, facing certain execution, Paul didn’t write with fear or regret. He wrote with clarity. With purpose. With urgency. His final words were not emotional farewells, but a deliberate call to action.

By the time he wrote 2 Timothy, Paul knew his time was short: “The time of my departure is at hand” (2 Tim. 4:6–8). His words to Timothy were like the final handoff in a race—a last charge to a beloved spiritual son. Paul urged Timothy to remain faithful, endure hardship, and guard the truth (2 Tim. 1:13–14; 2:3). He was passing the baton of ministry, and every word carried the weight of eternity. But Paul wasn’t the only one in Scripture who lived and spoke with urgency. The passionate cries of the prophets, the clear commands of Jesus, and the bold witness of the early church all echo with a consistent message: There’s no time to waste. Now is the time for obedience (2 Cor. 6:2). Now is the time for harvest (John 4:35).

Jesus Himself spoke with urgency when He said, “Do you not say, ‘There are still four months and then comes the harvest’? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are already white for harvest” (John 4:35). He didn’t point to a distant future—He pointed to the present moment. And what did He command in the face of this need? Not strength. Not strategy. Prayer. “Ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest field.” (Matt. 9:38). Jesus didn’t say “go recruit” or “train more workers.” He said pray—because only the Father can send the kind of laborers who understand the urgency of the harvest. Not just skilled workers, but Spirit-sent ones. Those who walk into each and every day with spiritual eyes open—eyes that recognize that the harvest can’t wait. But there’s something more: when Jesus told us to pray, He wasn’t just giving us a spiritual routine. He was teaching us something very important. That no matter how overwhelming the need is, we are not to rush in on our own. Yes, we may have gifts, experience, and a burden for the work—but if we don’t invite the Father into it, we’ll burn out trying to carry it alone. So before you move, pray. Don’t let your response to need be a knee-jerk reaction. Involve the Father. Walk with Him, not ahead of Him. He doesn’t just want your hands—He wants your partnership. He wants you to be a co-laborer in the field, not just a fixer of problems. Because urgency without intimacy leads to exhaustion, but urgency with Him leads to impact.

This week we will see that urgency in scripture is not about panic—it’s about purpose. It’s the response of hearts awakened to the weight of eternity, the value of the gospel, the magnitude of the harvest, and the passing nature of time. From Paul’s final letters to the cries of the prophets, from the immediacy of Jesus’ words to the boldness of the early church, we are reminded again and again: Now is the time. Not tomorrow. Not when life feels easier. Not when we feel more prepared. We are called to live urgent lives because souls are waiting, the harvest is ripe, and our days are numbered. So let the holy fire stir you to action. Let it move you to pray deeper, love harder, speak bolder, and obey faster. And whatever you do, don’t wait.
