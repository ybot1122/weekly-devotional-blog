In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth (Genesis 1:1). The creation story details what happened on the earth. After six days of creation, God saw that all He had made was good and perfect, and on the seventh day, He rested (Genesis 2:2-3). However, after this perfection, the enemy came. Interestingly, the enemy was never mentioned during creation. Yet, scripture suggests that rebellion against God had already taken place before humanity’s fall (Isaiah 14:12-15, Ezekiel 28:12-17). Despite this, God’s focus was on the beauty and order of His creation. Everything He made was whole, and His intention was for humanity to thrive in communion with Him. This is worth noting—God does not center His work on addressing the enemy, but rather on establishing His divine order. If we keep our eyes on Him, the enemy has no hold on us (Hebrews 12:2, James 4:7).

Yet, as is often the case, when something is perfect and good, the enemy seeks to corrupt it. Just like in the parable of the weeds (Matthew 13:24-30), the enemy came and sowed weeds—temptation and sin—causing man to fall (Genesis 3). Humanity was driven away from the beautiful garden that God had made. Things continued to spiral downward until Genesis 6, when God regretted making man because of the extent of human wickedness (Genesis 6:5-6). However, before taking any drastic step, God first shortened the human lifespan to limit the time for wickedness to take root (Genesis 6:3), but this did not change humanity’s ways. Therefore, in Genesis 6:5-8, God decided to destroy everything completely. Yet, His judgment was not without mercy—He did not erase humanity altogether. Instead, He chose to preserve righteousness by starting fresh with Noah, a righteous man (Genesis 6:8-9). The wickedness had grown so strong that it overshadowed the beauty of creation, and the only way to cleanse it was through complete destruction just like in the parable of the weeds. Yet, even in judgment, God’s justice and mercy were evident. He allowed 120 years for the ark to be built (Genesis 6:3), which was essentially a lifetime—ample time for warning and an opportunity for repentance.

The flood was not merely an act of destruction but a divine reset. Humanity had reached a tipping point where unchecked sin led to a world beyond repair. However, after the waters receded and Noah offered a sacrifice to God, God made a profound declaration: "Never again will I curse the ground because of humans, even though every inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood. And never again will I destroy all living creatures, as I have done. As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night will never cease." (Genesis 8:21-22). This promise was not just about nature—it was a reflection of God’s grace. Rather than intervening with judgment every time humanity faltered, God established a natural system of restoration that mirrors the rhythms of the earth. Instead of requiring destruction for renewal, He instituted seasons and cycles as a way for humanity to learn, grow, and change within the framework of divine order.

Instead of waiting for an entire lifetime for people to change—like in the days of Noah—God introduced seasons and cycles. Winter comes so that weeds may die, allowing space for new life to emerge. This is followed by a growing season in summer and then the harvest in autumn or the dry season. This cycle means that an ultimate harvest—the final judgment—is not needed for renewal to take place. God, in His wisdom, created a way for continual transformation. Solomon expands on this divine principle in Ecclesiastes 3:1-8: "There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens." (Ecclesiastes 3:1). Just as the earth undergoes cycles—planting and harvest, warmth and cold—so does human life. There are times of sorrow and times of joy, moments of tearing down and moments of building up. These seasons remind us that nothing is permanent except God’s sovereignty. Even in the hardest moments, renewal will come. Ecclesiastes 3:14 affirms: "I know that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it. God does it so that people will fear him." God’s method of restoration is woven into creation itself. Hardship may come, but it is always followed by renewal. Just as winter gives way to spring, suffering gives way to restoration, and brokenness gives way to healing.

God’s intention was not just to maintain the world but to bring back humanity to that beautiful garden of intimacy with Him. The stability of the seasons, the predictability of time, and the certainty that winter will always turn to spring—all serve as reminders of His faithfulness, mercy, and sovereignty (Lamentations 3:22-23, Psalm 136:1). The world may seem like it is in constant chaos, but it is not in a state of perpetual destruction. Instead, it moves in a rhythm that reflects God’s wisdom. He ensures that life continues, that people have the opportunity to repent, and that His grace is always present. The flood was not the final act of judgment, nor was it the template for how God would govern the world. Rather, through the establishment of seasons and time itself, God created a natural reset—ensuring that destruction would not always be necessary to bring renewal. Instead, the cycles of life serve as a continual reminder of His divine order, mercy, and unchanging faithfulness. Just as the earth experiences seasons of hardship and growth, so do we. But just as spring always follows winter, restoration follows brokenness, and mercy triumphs over judgment (Romans 8:28, Isaiah 61:3).

How do we embrace the seasons of renewal in our spiritual journey?
