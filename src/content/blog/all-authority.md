title: "All Authority"
description: "Last night was the Super Bowl—the American football equivalent of the FIFA World Cup. But it wasn’t just about the game. It was about something else, too: the staggering price of attention. A single 30-second ad cost a record-breaking $8 million. Let that sink in."

I know there are times when we are faced with situations that cause us to doubt God. We become preoccupied with the stone that’s blocking our access, or overwhelmed by the Anakites in our lives—the giants that make us feel unqualified or unworthy to step into the promise. Yes, the land may be flowing with milk and honey, but sometimes we believe we don’t belong there. Maybe you're staring down a qualification exam, a performance review, a job search, or the uncertainty of the next chapter. Those feelings are real. But Jesus speaks into that moment with power and peace: “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.” In that moment, He is not denying your fear—He is disarming it. He is not ignoring the stone—He is rolling it away. Yes, the mountain looks immovable, but He wants you to know: what feels like a dead end is not the end. You are correct—you can’t move it by yourself. But Jesus has made a way.

**Restored access, revealed glory**<br />
Matthew 28:18 – “Then Jesus came to them and said, ‘All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.’” When Jesus said this, He was standing on the other side of the grave. The cross was behind Him. The tomb was empty. His words were not about future power—they were about present authority. Nothing is outside His rule. And yet, this authority was not newly acquired—it was restored. As He prayed in John 17:5, “And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.” The authority Jesus carried after the resurrection was the same divine majesty He had shared with the Father from eternity. His mission had been fulfilled, and now that eternal glory was revealed once again. The whole point of Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection was to make a way for us to walk in—or share in—that same authority. Paul explains in 2 Corinthians 4:6, “For God, who said, ‘Let light shine out of darkness,’ made His light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God’s glory displayed in the face of Christ.” We can walk in Christ’s authority. And when we do, we are not asserting ourselves—we are reflecting the glory of God through the face of the risen Jesus. The restoration Jesus referred to in His prayer in John 17:5 is about what was lost in Eden. Jesus never lost His majesty—man lost his access. Humanity forfeited its ability to walk in divine authority and dominion by giving in to the lies of the serpent. But Jesus came to restore it. The restoration Jesus prayed for was not for Himself—it was to restore what we lost in the garden of Eden: divine access, dominion, and fellowship.

**The Angel sitting on the stone: A message for us**<br />
There is this powerful image in Matthew 28:2–3: “There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.” That detail—the angel sat on the stone—might seem small, but it is rich in symbolism. The stone that sealed death became a seat of authority. The object meant to block access became a platform of divine announcement. What was sealed and final was now rolled away and overcome. The angel’s posture wasn’t one of urgency—it was one of victory. He sat. He rested. And He waited. There is no need for anxiety about the grave because Jesus had already won. God doesn’t just move the obstacle—He transforms it. He turns barriers into platforms and makes us messengers of His power: “He is not here; He has risen, just as He said” (Matthew 28:6). The stone became part of the testimony and so do we.

**A different kind of preoccupation**<br />
When Jesus said, “Go therefore…”, He was not sending us out with human effort or religious obligation. He was commissioning us under the weight of His glory, the power of the cross, and the radiant light of God in our hearts. We carry this authority not to dominate, but to serve. Not to boast, but to proclaim truth, to roll back stones for others, and to lead them into the glorious light of Christ. Jesus gave us a new assignment—to make disciples of all nations. But in order to fulfill this calling, we must leave the comfort of what’s familiar, step out of our safe places, and be willing to go even to the ends of the earth. This calling is not passive—it is relentless and active: Go to where the hurting are. Go to the blind. Go to the lame. Go to the broken. You now carry within you all authority in heaven and on earth, and that authority calls you into a Jesus-level mission—to seek and save the lost. The whole purpose of His authority is captured in that one phrase: “Go therefore…”

**This week, we will explore what we need to walk in Christ's authority**

**Monday: Submission to Christ’s lordship-Luke 22:39-46**<br />
Before authority is exercised, it must be received through surrender. “He humbled himself by becoming obedient to death—even death on a cross. Therefore God exalted him…” (Philippians 2:8–9). To carry authority, we must walk in obedience. Jesus submitted to the Father’s will—even unto death. We too must lay down our own agendas and align with His.

**Tuesday: Revelation of His glory- Matthew 17:1-9**<br />
Walking in authority comes from a revelation of who Jesus truly is. “Glorify me… with the glory I had with you before the world began” (John 17:5). We must know Him as more than just Savior—we must know Him as King, the One exalted in power and glory from the beginning. That revelation fuels confidence and purpose.

**Wednesday: Intimacy with the Word and prayer- Psalm 119:9-18**<br />
Authority is sustained in the secret place—through abiding in His Word and presence.<br />
“The light of the knowledge of God’s glory is displayed in the face of Christ” (2 Corinthians 4:6). We behold His face through the Word and through worship. Authority grows when we live in close communion with Him, daily renewed by His truth and Spirit.

**Thursday: Faith in the Name of Jesus- Acts 3:1-16**<br />
We must believe in the power of His name, not our credentials or experience. “In my name, they will cast out demons…” (Mark 16:17). Authority isn’t based on volume, charisma, or emotion—it’s rooted in faith in the One who holds all power.

**Friday: Walking in righteousness and integrity- Psalm 15**<br />
Spiritual authority is not just about boldness—it’s about credibility before heaven. “The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective” (James 5:16). A clean heart and a pure life create space for the Spirit to move freely through us.

**Saturday: Alignment with the divine mission- Luke 10:1-20**<br />
Authority is not for self-promotion—it is given for God’s purpose: “Go therefore and make disciples…” (Matthew 28:19). Christ gives us authority to advance the Kingdom—not build our own. When our mission aligns with His, His power backs our steps.
