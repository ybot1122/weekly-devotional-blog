There is something inherently limiting about the pursuit of endless knowledge. Over time, I've observed that those who accumulate too much information often end up doing very little with it. The reason, I have found, comes down to a lack of faith. It is very hard to exercise faith when you believe you know—or think you know—the outcome of things. Consider Nathaniel’s question in John 1:46, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Knowledge gathers data, searches for patterns, and encourages us to act based on empirical trends. Yet faith asks us to set aside that reliance and embrace Nazareth as though we were hearing about it for the very first time.
