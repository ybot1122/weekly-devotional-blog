Peter was always the first to respond from that moment when his brother Andrew introduced him to Jesus. Andrew had simply said, “We have found the Messiah” (John 1:40–42). That introduction signaled a deep longing; they were actively searching for the One. But from Peter’s later interactions with Christ, it seems that initial introduction didn’t fully satisfy him. He still seemed to be searching, or perhaps struggling to believe that the long-awaited Messiah could come in such unexpected form. Like Israel in times past—who waited through cycles of promise, silence, and anticipation—Peter may have feared this too would end in disappointment. Perhaps that explains his restlessness: his need to be the first to act, the first to try; protective, impulsive, and always in motion. So, what was going on with Peter—and what does it mean for us?

First and foremost, we should all strive to be like Peter: never backing down or stepping away because of our flaws or limitations. Peter was deeply flawed; so much so that Jesus renamed him Peter, meaning “rock,” because his original name, Simon, represented instability (John 1:42; Matthew 16:18). This new name was not a declaration of who Peter was at the moment, but of who he would become. He was an unsteady rock—imperfect, impulsive, and inconsistent—yet chosen by Jesus as the foundation for something greater. In doing so, Jesus demonstrated how He builds His kingdom not on perfection, but on surrendered brokenness. Our flaws, when yielded to Him, become the very material through which He displays His strength and grace. Today, we will look at two key events in Peter’s life that I believe the Lord wants to use to speak to us.

**1. Walking on Water**<br />
Not many of us would dare to ask the Lord to let us join Him on the water. Most would be content simply confirming that it was indeed Jesus walking on the waves—without ever stepping out. But not Peter. For him, it wasn’t enough to witness the miracle; he had to experience it. Without hesitation, Jesus said, “Come” (Matthew 14:29). Peter stepped out and, for a moment, as long as his gaze remained fixed on Jesus, he walked on water. It was as if the waves didn’t exist. In those few moments, Peter was completely consumed by the presence of the Lord. He wasn’t trying to prove anything. He simply wanted to be sure it was Jesus. But as soon as Peter looked at the wind and the waves, he began to sink (v. 30). Doubt crept in. He felt the weight of his own inadequacy. He had stepped out in faith, but once he lost sight of Jesus, he lost his footing. This story teaches us a profound truth: we can do the impossible if our eyes remain fixed on Jesus (Hebrews 12:2). Jesus doesn’t respond to the size of our need. He responds to our gaze of faith. Peter didn’t need to walk on water; Jesus gave him that moment because, even in his uncertainty, he stepped out in faith and fixed his gaze on Him. Our gaze acts like glue, tethering us to Christ and aligning us with His divine purpose.

**2. The Denial of Jesus**<br />
When Jesus warned Peter that he would deny Him three times, Peter did not believe him. “Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will,” he said (Matthew 26:33). Peter was certain. He had reasoned it through and found no scenario where that would happen. But Peter’s desire to be first and front and center made him follow Jesus at a distance (Luke 22:54)—when he should have been drawing near in prayer (Matthew 26:40). That distance cost him access to the One who had redefined his life. Alone and spiritually disconnected, Peter denied Jesus—not once under threat, but three times in ordinary conversation (Luke 22:55–62). The turning point came when “the Lord turned and looked straight at Peter” (Luke 22:61). In that gaze, Peter saw himself clearly—and he wept bitterly. He had lost his focus, and in doing so, lost his footing again. We see this same version of Peter again after the resurrection—floundering, going back to what he knew: fishing (John 21:3). The absence of access to Jesus was Peter’s greatest vulnerability: his Achilles’ heel.

**Building on our brokenness**<br />
When Jesus promised, “And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age” (Matthew 28:20), and when He declared that we would receive the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:8), it was for moments like Peter’s. Moments when the waves drown out our vision. When fear and shame blind us from seeing Jesus clearly. The Holy Spirit lifts us, quickens us (Romans 8:11), and re-centers our focus back on Christ. Before transformation can take root, we must first acknowledge that this kind of failure isn’t just a mistake—it’s part of the spiritual battle we all face. Peter’s struggle was magnified by his impulsiveness, but the core issue is universal: keeping our gaze on Jesus.

We all battle distractions—our own agendas, our interpretations of what we think the Lord wants. But when the Holy Spirit speaks, it’s simple: “Come.” Step out of the boat. Focus on Jesus. In John 21:15–19, Jesus has a deeply personal conversation with Peter: “Do you love me more than these?” Jesus doesn’t specify what “these” are—and He didn’t need to. Peter understood. These could have been fishing nets, the other disciples, the constant need for validation, the comfort of familiarity, or Peter’s past failures. In every moment of glory, these distractions had popped up: the sinking, the rebukes (“Get behind me, Satan” – Matthew 16:23), the denial—each time, Peter stumbled after a breakthrough. Jesus didn’t want Peter to sweep these under the rug. He asked the same question three times to help Peter confront and process them—“Do you love me?” Your gaze and your love must be greater than the "these." They won’t vanish, but they must no longer define you. Your eyes on Jesus will.

Peter’s story reminds us that even the most passionate, powerful followers stumble when their gaze shifts. But Jesus doesn’t give up on us. He lifts, restores, and calls us again: “Follow Me.” (John 21:19) Let the fear of sinking not keep us stuck in the boat.  May we always remember to look up and find Jesus ready to lift us again.
