There is a kind of captivity that does not involve physical chains, yet it is just as restrictive. It is the captivity of the mind, an unseen stronghold that keeps people from walking in the fullness of what has been made available to them. In Ephesians 4:17, Paul warns against living in the futility of the mind—a state where people remain trapped in cycles of overthinking, self-imposed barriers, and a false sense of lack. This mindset does not only affect those who do not know God. In fact, Paul was addressing believers—those who have been made new in Christ—but who still live far below their inheritance because their thinking has not yet been transformed. They are saved but stuck—functioning with an old, limited mindset that keeps them from experiencing the abundance of God. There is an urgency in Paul’s tone—the same urgency captured in the story of the prodigal son in the voice of the father.

A perfect illustration of this is found in Luke 15:25-32, in the story of the Prodigal Son. Most of the time, our focus is on the younger son—the one who squandered his inheritance, repented, and was embraced by his father. But the real tragedy lies in the older brother—the one who never left home, yet still lived as though he were estranged from his father. When the younger son returned and was welcomed with a grand celebration, the older brother grew resentful and bitter. He complained, saying, "All these years I have been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders, yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends." (Luke 15:29). The father’s response reveals the disconnect in the older brother’s thinking: "Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours." (Luke 15:31). Here was a son who had full access to everything his father owned, yet he lived as though he had nothing. His issue was not lack—it was his perception of lack. He had an inheritance but never accessed it because he did not believe it was his to take. This is what Ephesians 4:17 warns against—being stuck in a futile way of thinking that prevents people from experiencing all that is already available to them in Christ. The tragedy is that many believers today live like the older brother—thinking like servants instead of sons, striving for what has already been freely given, feeling spiritually poor when they have full access to the riches of God's kingdom. So how do we break free from the futility of the mind? How do we step into the fullness of God instead of remaining stuck in cycles of overthinking, fear, and lack?

The answer is found in Psalm 34:8: "Taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the one who takes refuge in Him." This verse provides a simple yet powerful invitation—not to overthink, but to experience. "Taste" suggests action, not just contemplation. It is a call to bypass analysis and step into trust, even if that trust starts with something small. We don’t need to figure everything out at once. We just need to take one small bite of faith. We don’t need to wait for perfect certainty. We just need to try, trust, and see. We don’t eat a meal all at once; we take one bite at a time. Likewise, God doesn’t ask us to instantly grasp the fullness of His promises—He simply invites us to take a small step of faith and see.

Are you struggling to trust Him with your future? Start by trusting Him with today. Worried about provision? Start by believing for one small need. Overwhelmed by life’s uncertainties? Start by handing over one concern at a time. Go from thinking to experiencing. Overthinking keeps us in fear, but tasting leads to trust. Do not get trapped in the temptation to analyze His promises—trying to intellectually process everything before making a move. God’s invitation is not to figure Him out, but to experience Him. Taste and see, does not require you to analyze in order to conclude. Step out and trust, do not wait until you have all the answers.
