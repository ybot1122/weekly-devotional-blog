Resurrection is truly for dummies. It defies scientific explanation, logical analysis, and intellectual mastery. Jesus died, rose on the third day, and is alive. It's as simple—and as profound—as that. Luke 24:13–35 presents a vivid picture of something many of us are familiar with yet rarely acknowledge openly: post-resurrection disappointment. It's that lingering confusion, emptiness, or disillusionment that can follow significant spiritual moments. We have the head knowledge of Good Friday and the celebration of Easter, yet often we still find ourselves walking the Emmaus road. The two disciples on that road knew all about the events that unfolded between Friday and Sunday in Jerusalem. They could recite the facts—but something critical was missing. They had the narrative but lacked the transformative testimony.

When these disciples met a stranger (who was actually Jesus, though they didn't yet recognize Him), their tone revealed their disappointment. They were puzzled that anyone could be unaware of the remarkable events in Jerusalem, yet their voices betrayed their own disillusionment. They had expected more; their anticipation had not yet matched their experience. They had hoped, yet they were left empty. But as they continued their journey with this stranger, something extraordinary began to happen. Although initially their eyes were closed to recognizing Jesus, their hearts began to burn within them (Luke 24:32). His words sparked something deep inside—hope revived, expectations were reset, and their spirits stirred to life. This stranger gently guided them toward a new encounter with the risen Christ. He led them to see that the empty tomb was not just symbolic—it was a living promise. An empty tomb means a full life for us. It means the Lord is alive and actively fulfilling His promises concerning our lives.

They were indeed walking with the resurrected Lord. Their minds took time to comprehend, but their hearts sensed something powerful and real. And perhaps that's exactly how we feel today—the nagging sense that resurrection must mean more than just a story or annual celebration. Indeed, this is the essence of the gospel: Jesus rose from the dead and is alive to enforce His word, open our minds, and illuminate our hearts, inviting us into the ongoing experience of His resurrection power.

What can we practically learn from the Emmaus disciples to move beyond our own post-resurrection disappointment?<br />

1. **Honesty about our disappointment (Luke 24:17–21)**<br />
   The disciples openly expressed their confusion and discouragement. It’s important to be transparent with God and those around us about our disappointments. Transparency invites God into our real, raw places—and creates space for Him to meet us right where we are.
2. **Always go back to Scripture (Luke 24:25–27)**<br />
   Jesus pointed the disciples back to the Scriptures, reframing their experience in the light of God’s Word. In the same way, we must evaluate our own journeys not through opinions or trending posts, but through the unchanging truth of Scripture. Revisiting Scripture renews our perspective and aligns our expectations with God’s promises.
3. **Openness to encounter (Luke 24:28–29)**<br />
   Despite their disappointment, the disciples invited the stranger to stay with them, showing openness to new revelation. Maintaining an open heart towards God's presence, even amidst disappointment or delay, prepares us for transformative encounters.
4. **Recognizing Christ in ordinary moments and people (Luke 24:30–31)**<br />
   Their eyes were opened as they broke bread—an ordinary, everyday act. God’s presence often reveals itself most profoundly in the routine moments of life, if we only look closely enough and do not neglect the gathering of believers (Hebrews 10:25). May we also resist the urge to judge others hastily.
5. **Sharing our God-moments (Luke 24:32–35)**<br />
   Upon recognizing Jesus, the disciples immediately returned to Jerusalem and shared their experience. Sharing our testimonies of encounters with the Lord strengthens both our faith and the faith of others, reinforcing the reality of the resurrection in our lives.

The resurrection remains truly for dummies—those humble enough to trust beyond intellect, courageous enough to acknowledge disappointment, and open enough to recognize Jesus in everyday moments. Like the Emmaus disciples, may our eyes and minds be opened afresh to encounter and share in the living, transforming power of our resurrected Lord. May our past remain past and may the Lord lead us into a new chapter of walking in His resurrection power.
