title: "Embracing the Seasons"
description: "Instead of waiting for an entire lifetime for people to change—like in the days of Noah—God introduced seasons and cycles. Winter comes so that weeds may die, allowing space for new life to emerge."

Life teaches us that excess can be harmful, and even good things eventually come to an end. This cycle of change is a challenge we all face. The truth is, as human beings, we do not have the power to balance things—moderation does not come naturally to us. We either overdo it, or in an attempt not to overdo, we end up underdoing. We are like a pendulum—drawn to extremes and rarely staying in the middle. Like we learned last week, seasons are natural resets that seek to place us at the center of God's agenda. However, one side effect of the seasonal transitions is that they tend to create tension in our lives—we may favor one season over another and fear the next. This is a deception from the enemy; his strategy is to trap us in a season, keeping us stagnant and disconnected from God's plan.

The enemy fought to prevent the Israelites from leaving Egypt, and when he lost, he tried to keep them stranded in the wilderness. When that failed, he introduced countless distractions, ultimately leading to the children of Israel ending up in exile. The enemy’s strategy is always simple: keep us stuck in one season so that we never advance and experience all that God has prepared for us. Without seasons, we become stagnant and complacent. And a complacent Christian is a defeated Christian- always complaining and never advancing.

**The seasons of life and spiritual growth**<br />
In the world of wrestling and boxing, a champion must always train, even after securing the belt. Life’s seasons are like different opponents, each striving to take the belt from the champion. Ecclesiastes 3:2-8 speaks of these changing seasons, using contrasts to emphasize that every season serves a purpose. Therefore, we must always be prepared.

It is essential to embrace each season, no matter how bitter or painful, as it is a stepping stone to what comes next. Every season has a shelf life—it will eventually end and give way to another. As God’s champions and children, we must continue training, regardless of the opponent or season. Psalm 1:3 encourages us to be like a tree planted by streams of water, bearing fruit in its season. No matter what season we are in, we are called to remain fruitful. The streams of water remind us of God’s promise of constant refreshment for every season, sustaining us through both trials and triumphs. Paul also challenged Timothy with these words: "Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth." (2 Timothy 2:15). This is akin to urging Timothy to keep his training current, knowing that there is always another opponent seeking to steal the belt of truth. Fighting against a season is a futile struggle. Just as a farmer does not rush the harvest but patiently prepares for it, we, too, must embrace patience. Instead of dwelling on the hardships of a season, use that time wisely to prepare for what comes next.

**The unchanging nature and character of God**<br />
Despite the changing seasons, one thing remains constant—God’s mercies and compassion. Lamentations 3:22-23 teaches us: "Because of the Lord’s great love we are not consumed, for His compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness." No season—whether of loss, mourning, or hardship—can overwhelm us, for God's love sustains us. Seasons may shift, but God's presence and faithfulness remain unshaken. When God told Joshua to "Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the Lord your God goes with you; He will never leave you nor forsake you." (Deuteronomy 31:6). He was affirming that seasons of highs and lows would come, but God would remain constant, always fighting on our behalf. This is why we can embrace every season—each one provides an opportunity for God’s faithfulness to be revealed. With the Lord, we can conquer challenges, find joy, and make the most of every season that life brings. The enemy may believe he has us trapped, but in truth, he is unknowingly advancing God's divine plan.

- The enemy thought he led Jesus to the cross, thinking it was a defeat—but it was God’s plan for redemption (John 3:16).
- He thought he sent Joseph to Egypt, believing it was his downfall—but it was God’s way of preparing him for the throne. "What the enemy meant for evil, God used for good." (Genesis 50:20)

No matter the season, God’s love, purpose, and faithfulness will always shine through in your life.
