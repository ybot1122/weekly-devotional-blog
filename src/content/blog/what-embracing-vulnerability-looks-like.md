Last week, we discussed embracing vulnerability as a critical step in a year of total dependence on the Lord. But what does that really look like? While many of us can mentally relate to the idea of treasuring God's Word, the call to embrace vulnerability can sometimes feel vague or clichéd. It’s important to understand that treasuring God's Word goes beyond holding it in high esteem—it means actively pursuing His Word, even when it requires giving up everything. Treasuring God's Word is not just a position we hold; it’s an action we take. Surrender to the Word of God is the very act of embracing vulnerability.

Consider the story of young Samuel, who served under Eli in the temple. At this point in his life, Samuel did not yet know the Lord intimately. One night, God called out to Samuel by name. Unsure of what was happening, Samuel did the only thing he knew to do—he got out of bed and ran to Eli, assuming Eli had called him. Eli sent him back to bed, but the call came again, a second and a third time. Each time Samuel heard his name, he responded without hesitation, running to Eli, ready to serve.

Samuel didn’t grow frustrated or "wise up" after being mistaken. He didn’t let the fear of getting it wrong or feelings of inadequacy hold him back. Most importantly, he didn’t allow shame from misunderstanding to dictate his response. Instead, Samuel’s heart remained open and ready. This is what true surrender looks like—you never take it back, even in the face of rejection or repeated mistakes. Samuel kept coming back, every time he heard his name. He ran toward the one who had always guided him, even if it meant being mistaken again.

When Eli finally understood what was happening, he gave Samuel instructions that would define his life: “When you hear your name again, say, ‘Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening.’” And God, in His patience, called Samuel again. This interaction reveals a profound truth: God doesn’t stop calling. He gives us opportunities to respond, no matter how many times we stumble. This response is the essence of vulnerability—always listening, always waiting, never hesitating. Vulnerability before God is not about perfect understanding but about a readiness to respond. It’s not about always getting it right, but about not missing the call, even if it means failing and trying again. Just as Samuel remained raw and open to God’s voice, so can we approach Him with the same posture of surrender. It is in our humility and dependency that God reveals His power and invites us into deeper intimacy with Him. Samuel’s first encounter with God wasn’t perfect, but he was ready.

In contrast, Ezra 1 offers a different perspective on surrender. Here, there’s no audible voice or direct calling. Instead, God stirs the hearts of His people, prompting them to act. No names were called, yet the people responded to the burden, desire, or prompting that God placed within them. This demonstrates another dimension of how God moves. Is there a need around you that God has revealed to you or that you’ve observed? That too could be God moving your heart to respond.

God reaches out to us in many ways. Whether through a direct call, as with Samuel, or through a stirring in the heart, as with the people in Ezra, His invitation is for everyone—both the new believer and the seasoned follower. God is not concerned with our station or stature; all that matters is our willingness to say yes. This week, we’ll explore passages that teach us what it means to embrace vulnerability. As we examine these scriptures, let us reflect on how we can remain open to God’s call and respond with a heart of surrender.
