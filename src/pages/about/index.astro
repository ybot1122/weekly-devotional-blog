          > is a lover of God in purest simplicity whom God has graced with an unusual
          gift of revealing deep insights from plain scriptures. The Holy Spirit
          shows him truths which appear to have been hidden in our plain sight, rekindling
          our love for God and His ways in very profound ways.
        </p>

      <p>
        This gift began to find expression as an undergraduate over two decades
        ago while he was teaching and mentoring children and teenagers at the
        Christ Church Chapel of the University of Nigeria Nsukka. Many of those
        youngsters are now gospel ministers and leaders in different parts of
        the globe. This gift has continued to find expression in different
        churches and platforms since he moved to the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is married to his friend Ezinwanne, and they are blessed with three
        lovely children.
